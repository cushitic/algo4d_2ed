# Alogorithms for Dummies, 2nd Edition
## Using this Repository
This repository contains the downloadable source for Algorithms for Dummies, 2nd Edition. The code is usable in both Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook, but was created for the most part in Google Colab. The reason Luca and I have switched to Google Colab is to allow you to view and use the code from any device that supports an appropriate browser, even your tablet. One reader reportedly used a smartphone. Please contact [John Mueller](mailto:John@JohnMuellerBooks) if you have any problems with this site. You can find the complete source code archive on the website at http://www.johnmuellerbooks.com/source-code/. Any bugs or other issues in the book will be discussed on the blog at http://blog.johnmuellerbooks.com/.
## What's Special?
The source code for Algorithms For Dummies has been revisited by removing references to external packages.
